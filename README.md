# Ocular Disease Recognition
 Ocular diseases i.e., diseases concerning the eye, are a problem affecting people all over the world. With advancements in Image Computing and Artificial Intelligence by reading images and processing them using Deep Learning, the idea that an algorithm can recognize an ocular disease by looking at its image and aid the physician in diagnosis is a useful implementation for the medical industry as a whole.  In this project, we have implemented Deep Learning algorithms to read in images present in the dataset and classify said images based on the disease they are likely diagnosed with. The project was inspired by this dataset on Kaggle.
