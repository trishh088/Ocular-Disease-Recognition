# Ocular Disease Recognition

Ocular diseases i.e., diseases concerning the eye, are a problem affecting people all over the world. With advancements in Image Computing and Artificial Intelligence by reading images and processing them using Deep Learning, the idea that an algorithm can recognize an ocular disease by looking at its image and aid the physician in diagnosis is a useful implementation for the medical industry as a whole.  In this project, we have implemented Deep Learning algorithms to read in images present in the dataset and classify said images based on the disease they are likely diagnosed with. 

The project was inspired by [this dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/ocular-disease-recognition-odir5k). 

The diseases we tried to predict are:\
Normal (N),\
Diabetes (D),\
Glaucoma (G),\
Cataract (C),\
Age related Macular Degeneration (A),\
Hypertension (H),\
Pathological Myopia (M),\
Other diseases/abnormalities (O)\

We used algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks and pretrained models - VGG16 and ResNet50 and tried to tune the parameters in the 6 ipynb that we have.\
The results of the model's are shown below:
